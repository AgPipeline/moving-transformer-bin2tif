Title: Improving Image quality from illumination, contrast, noise, and color aspects.

Description
This extractor is designed to improve the RGB image (Gantry or UAS imaging systems) quality in term of visualization from four different aspects: illumination, contrast, noise, and color.

Input : RGB or grayscale image
Output : Enhanced image

Suggestion
This extractor can be combined with RGB image quality extractor. Whenever the image quality score is lower the expected value, this image enhancement algorithm can be triggered and apply to the raw input image.
